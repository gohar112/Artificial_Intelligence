Artificial Intelligence
	In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to 
the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives 
its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.
